# Intro personas

In the beginning... no one had programming experience yet... By the time you start this semester, you may or may not have had experience somewhere. In short: we are all alike in that we are all unique!

If you already have experience, it's a shame to start at the very beginning. Hence, we have described different personas. Decide which one suits you best and see what is being said about your persona.
