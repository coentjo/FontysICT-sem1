Where "Inge" appears may also read "Ivo" as needed, and where "she" appears may also read "he.

Inge already has programming experience. Maybe she has already made *methods*, maybe not yet, or not nearly. So we'll dive right in to find out, then work from there.

Here are some stages or steps that Inge might go through. One Step might be about 1 day's work for an average student.

You can find these assignments in the Toolkit Basics in the categories
[Variabele, assignment, types, debugger](../basic/#variabele-assignment-typen-debugger-eerste-stapjes-in-c)

## Step 1

- What is a method, how to work with returnvalues and how to use parameters?

You can find training assignments about this in the Toolkit Basics, for example: 
+ [Training method marathon](../basic/methoden/training_methodmarathon)


---

## Step 2

- Methods (repetition/expansion).
- What can I do with Collections (especially List and Array in C#)?

You will also find assignments on these in the Toolkit Basics: category loops, for example, the snappy ones:

+ [Training Christmas Tree Generator](../basic/lussen/training_Christmas-tree-generator)


---

## Step 3: Contest

+ After training enough, it's time to combine several things into bigger app (a ***Wedding*** app).
+ Also, before you start coding, try writing down WHAT an app is supposed to do and HOW.

In the Toolkit Basics there are (among other categories
['Integral Assignments'](../basic/#integrale-opdrachten)
, but also at ['Little Exercise, Training, Challenge'](../basic/#vingeroefening-training-challenge) ) ideas for contest apps. You are also welcome to come up with your own! The point is to make bigger apps in which you make frequent methods, use loops, collections, ... , the more the better!!!  Good luck and have fun.


Programming is in the basics of ICT, every ICT person should know 'something' about programming. **Inge** already has some programming experience and therefore has time to pay ***extra attention*** to learning how to program. It will always be useful in her further ICT career!


Good luck and have fun!
