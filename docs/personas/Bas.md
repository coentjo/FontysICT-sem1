# Bas, the absolute beginner

Where "Bas" appears may also read "Barbara" as needed, and where "he" appears may also read "she.

Bas has not yet (or almost not) programmed.

Below are some stages or steps that you could go through. One Step could be about 1 day's work for an average student.

---

## Step 1
If you can answer these questions you are done with Step 1:

-   [Question: What are the basic constructs of programming?](../basic/#variabelen-assignment-typen-debugger-eerste-stapjes-in-c)
-   [variables](../basic/#variabelen-assignment-typen-debugger-eerste-stapjes-in-c)
-   [Types like int, Double, Boolean](../basic/#variabelen-assignment-typen-debugger-eerste-stapjes-in-c)
-   [Type conversion (like Convert.ToString())](../basic/#variabelen-assignment-typen-debugger-eerste-stapjes-in-c)
-   [What is a project in programming terms?](../process/infoVisualStudioInstallatie)
-   [What is a statement?](../process/infoVisualStudioInstallatie)
-   [What is a conditional statement and what do I use it for?](../basic/#conditioneel)


Kies een opdracht om te maken. Als dat moeilijk is raden we aan er meer uit die categorie te maken:

+ [Training goeroe-calc](../basic/var/training_GoeroeCalc)
+ [Training Software boss](../basic/var/training_softwareBaas)
+ [Training ComputerCalc](../basic/var/training_ComputerRekenen)



You can find these assignments in the [Toolkit basics](../basic) in the categories 'Variables, assignment, typing, debugger: first steps in C#'. Also in category 'Conditional' are relevant assignments, such as:

+ [Training EuroDollarConvertor](../basic/var/training_Euro-Dollar-Converter)
+ [Training CalorieTracker](../basic/conditioneel/Calorieen-tracker)


Talk to your teacher regularly! That is the one who ultimately determines whether he/she/it is convinced of your ability.

---


## Step 2

- What is a repeating structure/loop, which ones are there (in C#), and what do I use them for?

You will also find assignments on this in the  [Toolkit basics](../basic/#lus--loop--herhaling):
+ [Training Dice generator](../basic/lussen/training_Worpengenerator)


Talk to your teacher regularly! That is the one who ultimately determines whether he/she/it is convinced of your ability. (The next steps won't mention this every time, but keep doing it).

---

## Step 3

- What is a method, how to work with returnvalues and how to use parameters?

Also about this you find commands in the  [Toolkit basics](../basic/#method-zelf-maken-en-aanroepen):

+ [Training Blood pressure](../basic/methoden/training_Bloeddruk)
+ [Training Times Three](../basic/methoden/training_MethodMaaldrie)
+ [Training Ampere](../basic/methoden/training_MethodAmpere)

---

## Step 4

- Methods (repetition/expansion).
- What can I do with Collections (especially List and Array in C#)?

You will also find commands about this in the  [Toolkit basics](../basic/#collectie-list-array):


+ [Training Television](../basic/collecties/Televisie) 
+ [Training Christmas-tree-generator (hard)](../basic/lussen/training_Christmas-tree-generator)

---

## Step 5

+ From now on I keep using methods.
+ Loops / repetition algo: project-Euler?

You can also find commands about this in the  [Toolkit basics](../basic/#method-zelf-maken-en-aanroepen):

+ [Training method marathon](../basic/methoden/training_methodmarathon)


---

## Step 6: Contest
+ Combine different things into bigger apps (that's what we call a ***Match*** app).
+ Also, before you start coding, try writing down WHAT an app should do and HOW. The answer to the **What** question we call Analysis, the answer to the **How** question is the (technical) design or design.

The [Toolkit basic](../basic) contains (among others in category
['Integral Assignments'](../basic/#integral-assignments))
, as well as at ['Finger Exercise, Training, Challenge'](../basic/#finger exercise-training-challenge) ) ideas for competition apps. You are also welcome to come up with your own! The point is to make bigger apps where you make frequent methods, use loops, collections, ... , the more the better!!!  Good luck and have fun.
