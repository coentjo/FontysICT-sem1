# Olaf met de OOP ervaring

## Dieper
<img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;" width="150" src="https://stasemsoft.github.io/softwarematerial/docs/personas/figures/olaf-small.png">Where "Olaf" appears may also read "Olivia" as needed, and where "he" appears may also read "she.

Olaf has already been introduced to Objects. Olaf will therefore not start from scratch but goes straight to the [Toolkit Advanced](../objects/). 

But: Note: You will not go through start-up, you will not receive 20,000 euros.... What do we mean by that: You may use classes and objects from the beginning, but that does not mean that your teacher is already convinced that you have mastered the concepts from orientation: talk to your teacher regularly and show that you make methods, loops, and everything else!

One assignment you could start with is the
[Challenge Duck Pond](../objects/challenges/challenge_Eendenvijver). 
This assignment is worded very *open*. Make something fun out of it, make stuff up! If you already know how to use *properties* and *constructors*: Show that you already know and can do that!

## Algo

Above all, look for some algorithmic challenge here and there!
For example, there are super-simple tasks (
[Training TrafficLight](../objects/training_Class_TrafficLight), 
[Training Marimba and Bass](../objects/training_Marimba_and_Bass)
), but prefer to go for the slightly more challenging
[Training CarDayValue](../objects/challenges/training_AutoDagWaarde).
 'Collecting Challenges*' and to
'*Codewars*':
[ter inspiratie](../objects/#diverse-uitdagingen-ter-inspi): live it up! Don't forget to talk to your teacher regularly!!!



## Contest

+ After you've *trained* enough, it's time to combine several things into a larger app (a ***Competition*** app).
+ Also, before you start coding, try writing down WHAT an app is supposed to do and HOW.

In the  [Toolkit basics](../basic) you will find (among others in category
['Integrale Opdrachten'](../basic/#integrale-opdrachten)
, but also at ['Vingeroefening, Training, Challenge'](../basic/#vingeroefening-training-challenge) ) ideas for contest apps. You are also welcome to come up with your own! The point is to create larger apps in which you make frequent methods, use loops, collections, ... , the more the better!!!  Good luck and have fun.


Programming is in the basics of ICT, every ICT person should know 'something' about programming. **Olaf** already has some programming experience and therefore has time to pay ***extra attention*** to learning how to program. She will always benefit in her further ICT career!


Good luck and have fun!
