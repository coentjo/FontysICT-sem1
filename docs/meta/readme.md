Types:
The idea is that the material is increasingly structured on ideas by Daniele Procida:
Based on the youtube video [What nobody tells you about documentation (Daniele Procida) ],https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4vKPhjcMZg). See also [the divio-site on documentation]https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/). Daniele proposes the following types:

* `Tutorial`: practical steps, learning oriented. Show how to get started. Minimum necessary explanation. Immediate sense of achievement.
* `How-to guide`: practical steps, problem oriented.
* `Discussion`: theoretical, understanding oriented.
* `Reference`: theoretical, information oriented. Accurate and complete.

At FHICT we distinguish further

* "Training" (formerly _exercises_): 'finger exercises', are part of a piece of theory to practice, but are evidence to convince your teacher not to use.
* "Fights": To convince your teacher that you don't only get it but also do it, you're going to come up with your own assignments, vary and expand on existing assignments!

Further principles:

* The focus is on the concepts: We want to teach someone how and why to create a Class, not specifically in C# or Visual Studio!
* Wherever possible we leave the programming language in the middle.
* GUI (Graphical User Interface) is therefore less important, so no unnecessary time to spend.
* only copyright-free material in these repos!
