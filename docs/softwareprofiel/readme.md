# Information about the software profile at FHICT

Once a semester we provide information about what the rest of study looks like if you choose software.

See the info in this
[powerpoint](Profielmarkt.Software.profiel.pptx).

If there are any questions, you can contact your own Software teacher with that, or of course the person who pesents the Profile Market. If they themselves do not belong to the Software Profile, they will probably refer you.
