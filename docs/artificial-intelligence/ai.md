# AI and GenAI, artificial intelligence

- ## What is AI?

    - When we talk about AI or Artificial Intelligence we mean everything done by a 'machine' that  looks like there is intelligence involved. So it can be a video service or social medium (like Netflix, Youtube, Insta, Facebook, TikTok, ...) that at the end of a video tries to seduce you into a next one that fits your preferences, or a Personal Assistent that helps you get your work done, or  Spell and Grammer checking in text editors. If you want more examples ask the question "Please give me some examples of AI" in [perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/) .
    - In the following we provide some links to places we think are helpful in discovering AI and/or GenAI. Have fun!

- ## What is GenAI?
	
    - Well, I could give you my opinion, but why not ask [perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/) ?
	
- ## Some background: LLM, GPT, Transformers

    - Great interactive site: https://ig.ft.com/generative-ai/
    - A nice overview of how it evolved: [How AI learned to Talk (30 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFS90-FX6pg)i
    - [But what is a GPT? (3Blue1Brown, youtube, 30 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjZofJX0v4M)

- ## Prompt & co
