# OOP in various languages

## Introduction
There are a number of concepts that are commonly seen as defining Object Oriented development. These concepts appear in many OOP languages, but are noted slightly differently in different languages (different syntax).

+ The concepts `class` and `object`/`instance`.
+ `constructor` (or `initializer`, `instance creating`, `new`)
+ `Encapsulation` (`properties`, `accessors`, `private`)
+ `static` methods, fields and properties.
+ `interface` (`protocol`, `abstract base class`)(so NOT as in: User Interface!)
+ `inheritance` (sub class, super class, base class, derived class).
+ Can you make up or find more internet?


Number of languages that are interesting to look at because there is a reasonable chance you will encounter them:
+ Java (C# and Java are close (how come?)).
+ Kotlin: Android.
+ Swift: iOS.
+ Python: (Applied Data Science; Infra semester 2).
+ C++ : devised to enable OOP in (an extension to) C. C++, like C, focuses on performance.
+ ... or are you interested in another language ...

## The assignment

Pick a language that seems interesting to you and go on the Internet to find how OOP concepts are implemented in that language.
Is there a student or teacher who already knows a language? Perhaps the teacher is eager to give a demo in her/his favo language?

+ Can you find all the concepts? If not, do they exist in that language? Why not? Do they have another solution?
+ Is it similar to what you are used to? Maybe it seems more convenient? Elegant syntax? Or just less readable?
+ Is the language 'natively' intended for OOP or does it seem to have been 'glued on' later?
+ Take a program you've programmed before and consider how different it would be in this language. More readable? Shorter?
+ Other questions are bound to surface as you work on it.
+ Also agree on what you want to deliver at the end: a (written) document?, a video?, presentation?
