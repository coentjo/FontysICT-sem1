# 99 Bottles of beer on the wall

Goal: Join fellow students/teacher in thinking about a program that intelligently generates the lyrics below (using the number of bottles as input):
```
3 bottles of beer on the wall 3 bottles of beer Take one down and pass it around 2 bottles of beer on the wall

2 bottles of beer on the wall 2 bottles of beer Take one down and pass it around 1 bottle of beer on the wall

1 bottle of beer on the wall 1 bottle of beer Take it down and pass it around No bottles of beer on the wall

No bottles of beer on the wall No bottles of beer There are no more to pass around No bottles of beer on the wall
```

(You can choose other lyrics, of course).
