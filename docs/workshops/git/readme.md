# Git

## Why.
Serious software engineering is not possible without version control. For several years, ***git*** has been the most widely used version control tool.

## Possible confusing terms

+ ***gitlab***: the **tool** *vs* the **site**. Gitlab is an open **tool**, downloadable from [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com). Install this on a server and users can create repositories on that server. An example is our own [FHICT-gitlab](https://git.fhict.nl), where students at FHICT can create repositories. Additionally, repositories can also be created on the ***site*** [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/explore).
+ ***github***: the **site** *vs* the **tool**: The *github.com* site allows you to create repositories.  The **tool** github, officially [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is available for download: it can be used to interact with repositories on the github site, but can also be used for interactiue with other git sites!
