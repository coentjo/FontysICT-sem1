# Submission of Visual Studio solutions

If you want to submit created `Visual Studio solutions` to Canvas,
keep the following in mind:
- During programming, let `Visual Studio` save all files to the place suggested by `Visual Studio`. (So do *not* save individual `files` using `save as` in other places).
- The result is that all files of a `solution` are together in 1 `directory`.
- The `default` place where `Visual Studio` stores `solutions` is `C:Â³ your user name>Source`.
- If you want to submit 1 `solution` you can `zip` the directory of that solution by selecting `send to|Compressed (zipped) Folder` in the *right mouse button* of the `directory`.
- If you want to submit several `solutions` in 1 zip you can select several of them (holding `ctrl` or `shift` and then clicking the `directories`), again using the same *right mouse menu* to zip.
- In Canvas, use the `Submit` button to submit the zip.
