About Coding Guidelines (FHICT)

In every programming language there are agreements about what code looks like. Many teams make additional agreements about this.


1. Most important rule: *Readability* and Maintainability of the code come first! It is possible to come up with an exception to every other rule, a case where it makes for more readable or maintainable code if you deviate from it. On the other hand, it's best to learn the *Reeglen der Kunst* properly first anyway before deviating from it!
2. The name of a `Class` is capitalized. A class name is normally in the *single*.
3. The name of a `Method` is capitalized in C#. Some teams agree on the order of the `Fields`, `Constructors`, `Methods` within a `Class`, but since in Visual Studio you can jump to the declaration of a `Method`, `Constructor` or `Variable` with `F12` it does not matter.
4. The name of a `local variable` is written with a lowercase letter.
5. The name of a `Property` is capitalized in C#.
6. Use clear indentation. How you put the braces and spaces and tabs can be done in several ways: the exact way can vary from team to team, and many editors can do this for you. If you do it manually, always do it the same way.
7. Get used to naming everything right away.
