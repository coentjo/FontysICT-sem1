#Training - Enum - School Grades

## Part 1

You have been asked by a high school in the US to create an application, which can easily retrieve whether a student has passed or not. In the US they use a different system than in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands you get a number between 1 and 10. In the U.S. you get a letter between A and F. The letters stand for the following numbers:

| Letter | Numeral |
| ------ | ------ |
| A | 90-100 |
| B | 80-89 |
| C | 70-79 |
| D | 60-69 |
| F | 0-59 |

The school has the following rules:

- A student has passed if he/she has earned a `D` or higher.
- A student has failed if he/she has obtained an `F`.


## Part 2

If you have a lot of time to spare, check out [this article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/io/how-to-read-text-from-a-file). Don't dive too deep into the code, but make sure your new system can read a file (from pure text). To display the data, you can use a listbox. Show which students have passed and which have not. Keep the following form:

```text
Name - Grade - Passed/Failed
```

```text
Adrian - D
Rebecca - A
Tiffany - C
Mel - C
Jeff - F
```
