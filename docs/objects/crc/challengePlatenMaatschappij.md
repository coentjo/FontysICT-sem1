Record company D'n Gulden Schijf wants to develop an application to keep track of their contacts in a database.

The company's contacts consist of artists, bands, managers and also suppliers who supply office supplies and raw materials for the company, for example. Of each artist or band, in addition to the usual name-and-address information, it should also keep track of what records (songs) they have released.

Each song consists of a title, the year of release and a duration (in minutes + seconds). As you browse through songs in the system you can click on each song to play. It then plays a high quality MP3 of that song.
Search function: it should be possible to search within the system by band name, manager, vendor or artist name.

The managers' data should include what their hourly rate (in euros) is. If a contact person is a supplier then besides the name + address data also the average delivery time (time in days) of the products of that supplier should be recorded.

In the case of a band, it should also be stored whether a special instrument is included (yes/no field). Special instruments are any instruments other than drums, keyboard, bass guitar and guitar. Examples of special instruments include a flute, harp, etc.

The system must be secured by a user+password system. Users (users) can log in with a username and password after which they have access to all data in the system.
