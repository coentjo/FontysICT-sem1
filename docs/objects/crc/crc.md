# CRC: Class, Responsibility, Collaboration

CRC cards were invented by 2 gurus in the OOP world, namely Ward Cunningham and Kent Beck (if you don't know what OOP means I'm sure you can figure out a way to find out?).

Needed: A stack of A4 sheets and pens (yes, on paper this works best!). From each A4 sheet you can make 4 'cards' (scissors will also come in handy). If you have a high table at which you can stand with 2 to 6 people that works fine. Everyone puts a few (still empty) cards in front of them... and start...

Preparation: If you watch the short intro video below and the example below, you probably already know enough to get started yourself!
