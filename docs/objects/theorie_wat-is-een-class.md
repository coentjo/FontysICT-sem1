What is a Class?

It is often said that a `Class` is a kind of *blueprint*: a *description* of how something should look and what that `thing` (indeed: `object`) can do. A 'class' defines a `type`.

For a boat, you first create a `design`, a `plan`: What kind of wood do you need? Where are the connections? What kind of engine will be installed? And so on.

This drawing, the blueprint, cannot sail. You cannot float on it. Only when the boat is built can you do something with it. You can even make multiple boats out of it! It's the same with classes. A **class** is therefore a blueprint for a **thing**, an **object**. You can only work with it once you **instantiate** the blueprint: create an **object** of that **type**.

Another comparison is that you can compare a `class` to an **assembly line**: From an assembly line, multiple things (`objects`) of a certain `type` can roll off: Every time I call `new` on the class, an object of that type rolls off the assembly line. How the assembly line is 'programmed' determines what an object of that type can ultimately do.
