Fill in the following words in the correct place: `Class`, `Instance`,
`Method`, `Operation`, `Object`, `Attribute`.

Note that a word can appear multiple times in the text,
and sometimes you enter the plural form of these words.

A programmer is required by his boss within a game to program the .......... "Character"
start programming. "Character" is already `specified` through
of a card on which all responsibilities are listed.
He is also given a `class diagram` with a clear overview
of the .........., including MoveForward and ValDoodNeer)
and the .......... (such as, for example, Number ofLives, HairColor and Number ofWeapons).

The programmer takes the chart and opens the existing `project`
in *Visual Studio*. There he will then program the new .......... into it.
First, he programs `Fields` for NumberLives and HairColor and
then he mapped the .......... MoveForward and ValDoorNeer to C#-...........

Once he has completely programmed the .......... he is going to `test` it
by creating a .......... of it with the `new-operator`.
He calls the .......... MoveForward to test if the character moves
is moving in the right direction.
Yes, it works!

He creates another .......... of &quot;Character&quot; to `test`
whether the `program` then still works. Yes!

Feeling satisfied, the programmer goes home at the end of the day.

Try filling it in yourself. Afterwards, check your answers in the
(or if you really can't figure it out yourself,
but then you better talk to students/teachers).
