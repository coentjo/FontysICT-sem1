# What can I do if I master "objects"?

## Explanation Advanced level

You apply the following programming concepts and have examples that demonstrate your mastery of the following concepts:

For the in-depth level, everything that applied to the exploratory level applies with the following additional requirements:

You apply all of the programming concepts listed. The focus here is on readable (e.g. naming, indentation) and maintainable software programs (so just a program that works is not good enough).

You create a design (CRC, class diagram) that reflects the most important functionality.

You ask for feedback from a teacher with software engineering knowledge and show that you have incorporated this feedback.

Concepts/Topics:
(NOT A CHECKLIST!)

1. objects / classes
1. constructors
1. encapsulation:
    + private fields
    + Get/set method and/or property
1. method/constructor overloading
1. *override ToString()*.
1. CRC / class diagram
1. Methods with (own) Classes as parameter or return value.
1. Classes in conjunction: *relationships* (between classes).
    + Multiplicity.
1. Separation of GUI and Domain.

You have also demonstrated and/or worked on the following skills:

+ V1. Readability/Maintainability.
    + Coding Guidelines followed?
    + Comments in code.  
    Sometimes useful, but don't go adding unnecessary comments!
    If a variable-, method- or class-name needs explanation,
    try to come up with a better name first.  
+ V2. Algorithm
+ V3. Feedback requested from teacher, noted, processed.
+ V4. Communicated professionally. In particular, I am on time, report to instructor if I am absent or late one time.  


A "sort of" checklist (non-complete) that can help:
+ To master concepts and practice with them you have done some "training".
+ In the 'contest' you show what you can do. In a contest app, an app(lication) created for the 'contest', you show that you know how multiple concepts are used within a maintainable app. The rules below are about your competition apps!
+ To convince yourself and a teacher that you can create classes, you have created at least 10 classes, of which at least 5 are within 1 contest app.
+ These classes have methods, fields, properties, constructors, etc.
+ In at least 5 classes you have added a meaningful 'override ToString()'.

## Info for teachers
Hi colleagues,

You will have noticed that the clock comes on at the end of the starting semester! This means that there are usually a few cases of doubt at the end. In that case, don't hesitate to consult with one or more of your Unit colleagues. It is an idea to firmly schedule an hour(?) somewhere in time with your Unitters when you discuss those doubtful cases. If it doesn't work out within the Unit please let us know and we'll see if we can get it arranged across Units. If there are questions about exact learning outcomes or level, please contact the chiefs.

As we know, it's not about 'tick lists' but rather that they understand what they are doing, have convinced you of this, and preferably have a decent chunk of evidence, either individual or proftask. If someone has used a fantastic framework in the pro task and claims that this has made classes obsolete, let them argue this (in writing in the in-depth report) and let them make an indiviual challenge in which they show that they have mastered classes: maybe you are convinced!?

The same concerning GUI: spending a lot of time on a GUI (WinForms, Asp.NET, you name it...) is not bad at all: as long as they have made a lot of classes, instances, ctors,... that meet our needs. After all, that is what it is all about.

Dot on the i: Design, specific class diagram: they must have thought about it, does not have to be done individually, can be done in proftask, is often done afterwards (discuss what they would do differently, in hindsight), does NOT have to be a formal UML Class Diagram, but like to be consistent, it is about them (ideally in advance) thinking about the problem and not proverbially starting to 'debug with the empty file', hopefully discussed with teacher and feedback processed!

Also ask about the learning curve!

Example: With an MBO Application developer who indicates that he already knew everything, has not learned anything new, you can tell him that you regret that he has not seized the opportunity to learn something new. Above all, ask why not.

Another example: someone who has never programmed before, indicates that it took him quite a while to understand how things worked with class vs. instance, or with encapsulation or constructors, but shows and explains a few assignments, may have learned a lot! (Even though maybe not everything is comme-il-faut).    

good luck with the completions!
