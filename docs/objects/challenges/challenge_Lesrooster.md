#Challenge Class Schedule


Ideal if you can do this on a whiteboard where you will stand with a group of people. Talk about what *classes* you think you will need if you are going to program a **Lesson Schedule** app. Try **together** to get to a good end result.


When you have thought of all the *classes*, think about what exactly you would call those classes: write those names down.



Pay attention to the following:
+ A *class name* starts with a *main letter*!
+ If an *object* of this *class* represents 1 object, use a *single* as the name (i.e., *Student*, *Monster*, or *Pion*).
+ In a compound name, each new word begins with a *capital* (so *CameelBump*, *StudentResult*, *SchessBoard*).
