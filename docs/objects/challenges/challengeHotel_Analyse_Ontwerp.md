## Hotel system - analysis and design phase

You will be given a case to program that you can work on in the coming period. Today, first create a draft (document) of all the classes (with already as many methods and properties as possible) you want to program, and hand it in.
Tips:

- First make a prioritized list of all the functionalities that need to be in the application (=analysis).
- Deliver your class design and analysis document as soon as possible. This shows that you have thought about your application in advance (before you started programming).

Technical requirement
Contrary to what the letter says, the hotel system does NOT have a database. The data should be stored in a text file. So you don't need to design a database but you do need to design a neat class diagram with navigational relationships and multiplicities.
