If you haven't yet worked on a Windows Phone app at OIS11 you can do so nicely now!
Goal: to program a Windows Phone app that uses GPS location to show whether you are at home or at school.
In doing so, you can proceed step-by-step. Make sure you go through all the steps in a calm and controlled manner; you are not in a hurry. The goal is for you to learn something. The end goal is not a working app (although that would be nice, of course).
1. Research what you need to develop Windwos Phone apps (e.g. correct version of Windows and correct version of Visual Studio and supporting tools to run a Windows Phone emulator).
Install the complete development environment and test that the Windows Phone emulator works 2. Get the emulator working. Tip: you can also borrow a real device (Windows phone or tablet) from the ISSD, of course.
3. Research how to read the GPS (position) of the user in Windows Phone and find an algorithm to determine if you are closer to home or school.
4. Program the app.
Extension
1. Expand your working app with a Bing-maps map or a Google-maps map. To do this, first research what you'll need for that, such as a developer API key and perhaps an external library. Show the following on the map with a triplet of markers:
a. A marker indicating the phone's current GPS position.
b. A marker indicating the school (Rachel's Mill 1).
c. A marker indicating your home location.
