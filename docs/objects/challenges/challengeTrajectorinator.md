# Challenge Trajectorinator

Rayenne's route from A to D is divided into 3 sections: A-B, B-C, C-D. A-B takes 30 minutes: average speed: 80 km/h gasoline consumption: 5.25 liters / 100 km. B-C 20 minutes, average speed 90 km/h, 5 liters / 100 km. C-D 40 minutes, average speed 120 km/h, 8 l / 100 km The average gasoline consumption during the whole route A-D is 1 on ... (i.e., how many km does she drive on average on 1 liter of gasoline?) (Fill in a whole number. Round off if necessary).

      

The challenge: write a program that calculates the answer. In doing so, as an ICT person, make sure that the user can also chop the route into parts with their own values for duration, average speed and liters/km.
