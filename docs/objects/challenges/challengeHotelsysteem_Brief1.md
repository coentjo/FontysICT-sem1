Subject: hotel reservation system specification
Gentlemen,
Following our conversation last Wednesday, we hereby send you the specification of our hotel system. If you have any questions, please feel free to email or call us. But we think we are complete in this letter.
Specification
Reservation of rooms must be possible per room but more than one person can stay in a room at the same time (as long as this is possible, each room can accommodate 4 persons). The usual name and address information of the visitors must be available in our system.
Besides reserving a room, people who have already reserved a room can also reserve (on the nights they attend) for dinner. This must be done at least 2 days before dinner. Reservations can also be made for breakfast.
In the future we also want to rent out single and double rooms, at the moment we only work with 4-person rooms.
We as management would like to have a daily overview of all reserved rooms and an overview of all rooms that are occupied at that moment (that day), and also we would like to see how many people are in that room then.
Reservations are made by phone, our secretary then enters the reservations, into the system. Both for dinner/breakfast and for the rooms.
If possible, we would also like a hand-holding when entering the reservations for dinner and breakfast so that we can link all persons in a room to breakfast or dinner at once.
Sincerely we stay,

Mr. Drs. P. van Trommelen
Director Grand Hotel D'n Gaarkeuken
