Subject: hotel reservation system specification

Dear gurus,
Following our conversation last Wednesday, I hereby send you the specification of our hotel system. If you have any questions you can always call me. I am the operator so I am always by the phone.
We want to be able to see in our system all the 4-bed rooms of our hotel so we can see at any time which rooms are free and which are not.
I want to be able to see all the names of visitors, sorted neatly by room. And I also want to be able to see who made reservations for dinner and breakfast. I'll type the visitor data into the system myself, along with the date they want to rent their room.
My boss also wants to be able to see the visitors' addresses and the dates a room was reserved. But that doesn't have to be on the screen, may also be in a file.
The files with information must be backed up every day, but our computer guy takes care of that, you don't have to.
If you still have time to spare: when making reservations we do want to be able to link several people at once to a dinner or breakfast. For example, by selecting a room and then it automatically links all those people from that room.
Thank you for your efforts,
Greetings,
Marieke van Trommelen
Receptionist Grand Hotel D'n Gaarkeuken
