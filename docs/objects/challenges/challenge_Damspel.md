# Challenge Classes for a Game of Checkers



Ideal if you can do this on a whiteboard where you will stand with a group of people. Talk about what _classes_ you think you will need if you are going to program a **Dam game**. Try **together** to get to a good end result.


When you have figured out all the *classes*, then think about what exactly you would call those classes: write those names down. Remember that also the *current state* of the game must be stored in objects.  



Please note the following for this challenge:
+ A *class name* begins with a capital letter!
+ If an *object* of this *class* represents 1 object, use a **single** as the name (i.e., *Student*, *Monster*, or *Pion*).
+ In a compound name, each new word begins with a **capital** letter (so *CameelBump*, *StudentResult*, *SchessBoard*).
