## Hotel System Program Code

Continue working on your code for the hotel system. Make it as pretty as you can where pretty means that your C# code looks slick with a clear class structure and good distribution of functionalities across the various classes and methods.
Separation of UI and code, exception handling
Make sure you don't have user interface code (such as MessageBoxes) in your classes. Use exception handling where necessary.
Classes, lists and casting
In OIS12 you work with lists (of objects, not strings) and use casting to retrieve an object selected by the user. Each class has a ToString so that it shows up properly in the UI.
Submit all your code in a zip file.
Technical requirement.
The hotel system does NOT have a database. The data should be stored in a text file.
Again: the app should NOT use a database! Do not.
