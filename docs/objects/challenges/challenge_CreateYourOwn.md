# Create your own challenge

A very good way to learn and see if you completely
understand a subject is to create your own challenge.

## Puzzle or Game
Take a game or puzzle in mind and think about how you can implement it.
Some examples:

+ *tic-tac-toe*
+ *tetris*
+ *sudoku*
+ *mastermind*
+ *snake* or *tron*
+ *2048*

## Create teaching materials
You also help your fellow students when you develop your own teaching materials
develop teaching materials for a new programming assignment.
Write your own assignment and submit it to the instructor.
Then we will adopt your idea and your own assignment idea might live
live on as official teaching material.
