## Hotel system universal

If all goes well, you have properly separated the code of your Hotel system from the user interface (Forms). Now, to prove that you really did that well, you are going to create a new project where you are only going to change the User Interface of your system.
Create a Windows Universal app with Visual Studio and recreate a User Interface (screens) of your Hotel system. You are going to reuse your existing classes of code.
Learning Objective
You will be able to create user interfaces for applications using both the Windows Forms designer and the XAML designer.
