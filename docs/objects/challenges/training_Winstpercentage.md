# Challenge Profit Percentage

Another challenge inspired by www.beterrekenen.nl:

Karel van de Kaart is addicted to a card game on the computer. He has played 679 games and won 555 of them. So a winning percentage of 555 : 679 x 100% = 81.74%.

This score is always rounded to 2 decimal places. If from now on Karel wins ... wins games in a row and loses nothing more, the winning percentage is (for the first time) 82% or higher. (Enter a whole number).

Write a program that calculates the answer and make the program so that the user can change the numbers.
