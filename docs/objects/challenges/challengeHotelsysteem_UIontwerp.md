Subject: hotel reservation system specification, attachment UI design
Annex hotel system letter
Gentlemen,
To supplement our letter about our hotel system specification, today we are sending you the UI design as created by our user interface design firm. It is only a rough sketch, additions on your part are welcome. Feel free to deviate from it, that's no problem either. We leave it entirely up to you.
However, we have agreed that in order to ensure the maintainability of the code, we have four additional technical requirements for the program you will develop:
1. The class diagram must first be created and sent to the project leader for approval.
Our new logo (green circle with thick red line through it) must be drawn with GDI Graphics 2.
3. The data must NOT be stored in a database.
4. There must be an export to a file of all names of all hotel guests 4.
 
Sincerely we stay,

Mr. Ing. Q. van Trommelen
Project manager Grand Hotel D'n Gaarkeuken
