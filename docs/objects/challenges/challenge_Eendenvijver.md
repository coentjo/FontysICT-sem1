# Challenge Duck Pond

If you already know how to program with objects you can demonstrate this
demonstrate this by creating the attached `challenge` and discussing it with your teacher
discuss.

## Hint
It is all about the concepts! Whether it looks pretty is NOT IMPORTANT to show whether you can program! What is important is whether you use classes, encapsulation, ...

## Challenge Duck Pond

Create a project called `DucksPondVan` with your own name behind it.
In that pond there are 26 ducks. A duck can be a female or male:
This is determined when you create the ''object'' for that duck,
so you create a constructor with the parameter of whether it's a
female or male. Furthermore, I can ask a duck
(choose how) whether it is male or female.

The pond contains frogs.
Objects are also created for these.

Create a class `Stork`.
The stork gets a method called `EatFrog`,
with at least the frog being eaten as a parameter.
Somewhere in your program you have to call this method.


## What does the app need to satisfy?

Add things to make it *logical*. Don't be satisfied too quickly, if you want to show that you are a master of OOP, you can make this an elaborate program!

Discuss your solution with your teacher: write down the feedback! Discuss with the teacher what you can best concentrate on.

Some ideas:

+ Create a *Class-library* (choose as project type when creating project) that contains the classes Frog, Stork ... and the logic. Then 2 User Interfaces (e.g. a Console app and a WinForms app) using the classes from the class library.

+ I need to be able to ask a stork if it has eaten a specific frog.

+ A frog can have 3 genders: male, female or I-don't-want-to-say.

+ Let a frog randomly change gender once in a while. The stork then only likes frogs that have the same gender as the stork.

+ Do not use *string* or *int* as gender, but a suitable *type*!
