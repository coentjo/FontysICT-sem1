In this assignment you will work with Unity.
Arrays, lists and classes will be discussed.
Unity works a little different than you might be used to.
The starting material can be found behind the url:
[starting material](https://github.com/coentjo/softwarelessons/raw/master/Challenge_Starting_Material/Challenge_start_AdvancedMemory_in_Unity3D.zip)
Take a look at:
[Instantiate](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.Instantiate.html)
[Coroutines](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Coroutines.html)
Unity also has the full scripting reference built in.
Pressing F1 in the editor will open it.
On the internet you can also find a lot of stuff, also thanks to Unity answers,
where users can ask questions that are then answered by the community.
On youtube there are many different tutorials made by users.
Also Unity itself has a lot of free training material,
they also do live training that can be watched back afterwards:

##### The Unity project
The project was created in Unity version 5.1.3f1. If you have downloaded the latest version you are always in the right place.
In the project you will find a fully working example.
Furthermore you will find a folder with DIY.
In there some things are already set up for you.
In the code you will find comments with all the steps you need to take.
In the example you can see how you could do this.
**Good luck!
