As a starting material, the program Name Generator is available. Open this solution and take a look at the code.
The program generates a random name from a list of available names and displays that name on the screen. The list of available names is contained in the file Names.txt. The program reads this file.

### Assignment 1

Add C# code that handles all the exceptions of the program
such as the IndexOutOfRangeException
and file/network related exceptions
and show a clear error message to the user
or (even better) resolve the error without the user seeing it.
### Assignment 2

Extend the program so that either 1 or 2 names are selected as desired.
The user must choose in advance whether to see 2 names or 1 name.
Add user interface controls, and replace existing controls of your choice.
