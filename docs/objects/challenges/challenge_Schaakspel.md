# Challenge (Classes for a) Chess game

Ideal if you can do this on a whiteboard where you will stand with a group of people. Talk about what classes you think you will need when programming a Chess game. Try to come up with a good end result together.

When you have thought of all the classes, then think about what exactly you would call those classes. write those names down. Remember that also the current state of the game must be stored in objects.

Note the following in this challenge:
+ A class name starts with a capital letter!
+ If an object of this class represents 1 object, use a singular name (i.e. Student, Monster, or Pawn).
+ In a compound name, each new word begins with a capital letter (i.e. CamelBump, StudentResult, ChessBoard).
