Subject: hotel reservation system specification

Hi,
I promised to send you some more specs of our hotel reservation system. I made a list so you can start programming it for us soon:
1. Visitors must be able to reserve rooms, max 4 people per room. Reservations can only be made for dates in the future. You must also be able to undo a reservation.
2. All personal data such as name, address, sex, age should be neatly stored in a file.
3. Reservations for dinner or breakfast on a certain date should be possible. If possible also be able to put a whole room at once (all 4 people) on breakfast or dinner.
4. Management and I want to be able to see an overview of all occupied rooms and all reservations.
5. The typing of a reservation and the personal data is done by our secretary.
And just the promised background info:
We have 312 rooms, only room number 13 we don't have. All rooms are for 4 people at the moment (this might change in the future). In the files you can enter some (4 or so) rooms as test data, the rest we will do ourselves. This may be done directly in the database.
Thanks so far, with kind regards,
Dennis van Trommelen
