#Training The Three Squares

Write a program that meets the following requirements. It may be a Console app, or a WinForm app, or maybe something else?

![3 vierkanten](figures/drievierkanten.png)
+ The user enters the length of a side of three different squares. These three values are stored in three variables of type int.
+ The area of all three squares is calculated.
+ The total area of all three squares together (i.e. area1 + area2 + area3) is displayed to the user.


+ Write a `method` that can calculate the area of a square. The method has a parameter (representing the length of a side of the square) and returns (`return`) the area of the square.
+ Use your method to enhance the code created above (call method).
