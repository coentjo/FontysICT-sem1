# Training with Method Each Other Backwards

Create a method `EachBackwards` that has as return value a `bool` and 2 parameters of type `String`. The method returns `true` exactly then if one string is equal to the other backwards.

Hint: Use the String method `SubString` to isolate single letters from words.
