# Training with method, List and Array

Create a method `ListEqualsArray` that has as return value a `bool` and 2 parameters: 1 List<int> and 1 Array<int>. The method returns `true` exactly then if the contents of the List and the Array are exactly equal to each other.

Note that the elements may well be in a different order!
