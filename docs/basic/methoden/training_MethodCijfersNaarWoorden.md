# Training: Method numbers to words

Create a method `FiguresToWords` that has as parameter a `String` and as return value also a `String`.

Write a program that picks up the user's text and replaces all digits there with words. So if the user

```
I am 20 years old
```

then the output is

```
I am tweenul years.
```

Conditions:
+ The functionality that changes one digit must be in a separate method (and that method must NOT interact with any user interface). Call this method ChangeDigit.
