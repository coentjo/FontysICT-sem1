# Training - Mad lad lyrics

A Mad lad text is a text where the number of characters is even and where the second half of the string is the mirror image of the first half. For example, the strings **coffeeeiffok**, **waterretaw** and **brillirb** are all Mad lad texts.

Write a program where the user can enter a text and the program will output "You are a mad lad!" or "You are sooo basic!" if it is not a Mad lad text.
