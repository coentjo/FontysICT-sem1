## Toelichting OriÃ«nterend level

You apply the following programming concepts and have examples showing that you control the following concepts:

DIT IS GEEN AFVINK-LIJST!

* Variable
* Conditional statement
* Loop
* Methods
* Parameters bij Methods
* Returnvalues bij Methods
* List
* Array
* Enum
* type int, string, double, bool

You have also shown and/or worked on the following skills:

* Readability / Maintenance
* Algorithmics
* Feedback requested from teacher, noted in feed pulse and shows what you have done with this feedback.
* Professional communicated. Especially I'm on time, I sign off on teacher if I'm not there or late.

A "type" checklist (non-complete) that can help:

* To master concepts and practice with them you have done a number of 'trainings'.
* In the game, you show what you got. In a competition app, an app made for the competition, you show that you know how to use multiple concepts within a maintenance app.
* To convince yourself and a teacher that you can create methods, you have created at least 15 methods, of which at least 5 within one competition-solution/project.
* You have created at least 5 methods that have (at least) 1 parameter.
* At least 5 methods with a return value.
