# Training card game

  

Concepts: arrays, methods

  

This can be done in a WinForm app (as in the description below) but may also be done on the Console or else.

  

Create an application in which you put a listbox and a generatebutton. When you click on the generate button, a “card” (a string with e.g. H3-> hearts 3) should be randomly generated from the deck. This card should end up in the listbox.To do this, create a method “GenerateCard”. This method must return a string with the card code (e.g. H3-> hearts three, S2-> spades 2, SK-> spades king).  

Extend the game by also counting how many of each type (spades, hearts, clubs or diamonds) have been generated.
