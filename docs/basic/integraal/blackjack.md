# Training Blackjack (light)

  

Make the card game [blackjack](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack). The aim of the game is to beat the bank (dealer). In doing so, one must try to get closer to 21 points than the bank. If the player results above 21 points he has lost, no matter what the bank has.  

First make the game so that there is 1 bank and 1 player.



## Rules  

- The bank draws a card first, then the player. As the player, you cannot see the bank's cards.

- When the player draws the card, the player may choose to draw another card or quit. When the player stops, the bank may continue to draw cards until the bank “agrees” (what this is you may determine and program yourself).

- As a player, you must get as close to 21 as possible.If the player scores above 21 he has lost, regardless of what the bank has.  

- use a deck of 52 cards

## Points

- Jack, queen and king are worth 10 points  

- 2 - 10 cards have the value they indicate  

- ace is worth 1 or 11 points.Depending on which value is closest to 21.

## Extensions  

- more players  

- more sets of cards  

- expand this with the rules of blackjack (doubling, splitting, etc...)  

- score keeping  

- visual display with “real cards”
