# Training from number to word

Create an application that can print integers into words.  

## Extension options.
1. give user option to turn “one” on or off (e.g., one thousand/one thousand) 
2. give user option to toggle between “one thousand two hundred” and “twelve hundred”
3. make it possible for multiple languages: NL, EN, FR, etc.

Of course you create neat and maintainable code. To achieve this, expand your program in small steps (numbers, tens, hundreds, etc.). Ask for feedback for each extension you make.
