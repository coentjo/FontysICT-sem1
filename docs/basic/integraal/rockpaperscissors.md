# Training Rock Paper Scissors

  

Make the game “paper rock scissors”.

  

This can be done in a WinForm app (as in the description below) but can also be done on the Console or elsewhere.

  

Through radio buttons you can choose whether you want paper, rock or scissors. When you click the “Play” button afterwards, a paper, rock or scissor is automatically chosen for the opponent. Then the winner is determined. The results (draw, win or lose) are put in a listbox and a record is kept of how often you draw, win or lose.This is put in textboxes.
