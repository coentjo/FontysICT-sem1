# Training - Calculate prices including VAT

Create a program where you can enter a price in a textbox. Then as a user, you should still have the choice between high and low VAT rates. Put these two choices in a combobox or use a radio button. Depending on the choice, after pressing the button, you should show the price including 6% or 21% VAT.
