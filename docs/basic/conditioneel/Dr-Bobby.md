# Training - Dr. Bobby

Dr. Bobby is a computer psychiatrist. You will program Dr. Bobby by writing a program that meets the following requirements:

The user can ask a question to the system by typing it in a textbox and clicking on a button. After clicking the button, the answer will appear.
1. If the question starts with the word _why_ then Dr. Bobby responds with "Why do you think?". 
2. If the question starts with the word _who_ then Dr. Bobby responds with "Who do you think, <rest>" where <rest> is equal to the text filled in by the user minus _who_. Example: The user types "Who is Santa Claus?" Dr. Bobby: Who do you think, is Santa Claus?" 
3. If the question starts with the word _what_ then Dr. Bobby responds with "What do you think, <rest>" where <rest> is equal to the text filled in by the user minus _what_. Example: The user types "What is the purpose of this conversation?" Dr. Bobby: What do you think, is the purpose of this conversation?" 
4. In other cases, Dr. Boddy responds "Why do you want to know, do you think?"
