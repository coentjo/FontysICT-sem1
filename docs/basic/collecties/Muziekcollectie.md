# Training - List methods - Digital music collection

Create an application to keep track of your digital music collection. Allow the user of your app to add an album to your collection. Use a List for this. Display all albums in a ListBox.

The user should also be able to search for albums in the collection. Implement functionality for this. Albums should also be able to be removed. The user must provide the index number of the album to be removed. When adding, make sure to check if the album is not already in the collection.

*Tip: Use the Contains and IndexOf methods of Lists.*
