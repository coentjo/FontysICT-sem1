Training - Array - Slot Machine

Create a slot machine application. Make it so that with a press of a button, you see three different images. Make sure to write the code in a way that it can easily be expanded from, for example, 3 to multiple "slots" (images).

*Tip: You will need the Random class for the implementation. Think about where you could use an array. It is possible to do it without an array, but that is not the goal of this assignment. Furthermore, the code would not be easily expandable to a random number of "slots".*
