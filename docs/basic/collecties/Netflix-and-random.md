Training - Array - Netflix and random

You are sitting with your (future?) loved one on your bed in your cool student room. Together with your loved one, you want to watch a movie on Netflix. Since you are only a fan of Avant-garde films and you also want to please your loved one, you have your own custom-made application ready. This application will help you choose the movie.

Create this application where you can choose between five different genres using radio buttons. When a radio button is clicked, a random movie from that genre should be displayed.

These movies come from five different arrays (each array has one genre).

- When a genre is chosen: show an image of the genre
- For the real diehards: connect it to the Movie API. https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction
