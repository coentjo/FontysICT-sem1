## Question: How much is 8 divided by 3?

My program says 2. How can that be?

## Puzzle: My math app is sometimes correct, sometimes not.... rara?

I wrote a program that adds 2 numbers. In testing, I used `3 + 3` and it came up with `6`: Yes, I thought. Then when I tried `17 + 27` it came up with `54`. How is that possible? Sometimes right, sometimes not?

Without seeing the code, can you think of an error that would cause this?
