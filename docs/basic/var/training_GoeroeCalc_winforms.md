# Training Guru-calc: variables, operations and conversions

(Concepts: int, double, operations and conversions)

## Preparation

Do you know the difference between an int, double and string?

## Introduction

We are going to make a working calculator. It's a minimalist calculator, but it can calculate things for you that you can't do yourself. How much is 655 times 23623? Humans prefer to use a program for that. You can make that program.

## Assignment

Create the user interface of the calculator where you have at least two Textboxes, a Label and two Buttons (one for addition and one for multiplication).

The user can enter integers in the text boxes. Now program the functionality of the calculator according to the following specification:

+ If the user clicks the Plus button then the two numbers entered are added together and displayed in a label as the result.
+ If the user clicks the Multiply button then the two numbers entered are multiplied together and displayed in a label as the result.

Did you succeed? Then you have now written yourself a program that can do more than yourself (multiply the numbers 7225 and 5588 within a millisecond, for example) and have taken the first step toward becoming an experienced software engineer.

Stuck? Ask a question of your neighbor! If you can't figure it out together ask your teacher. In the beginning, this programming can be quite difficult.

If the calculator works then you can program the last 2 requirements. These are:
+ The outcome is shown as "Outcome: 123" in a label so with the text "Outcome: ": in front of the actual outcome.
+ The calculator must work with broken numbers. So 3.14 times 2.0 should yield 6.28.

Maybe you already had it, then you are not only good at programming, but you also passed the analysis phase honorably.

Discuss this assignment with your teacher and enter feedback from your teacher in Feedpulse.

## Extras

Would you like smiley faces in Feedpulse? Then make up extensions to the assignments or assignments of your own and request feedback (note: you must be able to program these extras yourself for a higher grade, code copy from the Internet is not sufficient). Some possible extensions:

+ Extend the calculator with a function for root subtraction.
+ Make the label text red (red letters) if the result is below zero.
+ Extend the calculator with a function for division. Ensure that dividing by 0 is neatly captured and shows a neat error message.
