# Basic knowledge: Int and double operations (operators)

The operations below apply to both `int` `types` and
to `double` types:
```cs
int k;
k = 5 + 10;
```
Variable *k* is assigned the value `15` in the last line of code
because the `+` sign adds the values `5` and `10` together.
```cs
int i = 2;
int k;
k = i + 1;
```
Variable *k* is assigned the value 3 in the last line of code
because the `+` sign adds the values `2` and `1` together.
```cs
int i = -8;
int k;
k = 1 + i;
```
Variable *k* is assigned the value `-7` in the last line of code
because the `+` sign adds the values `1` and `-8` together.
```cs
int i = 5;
int j = 3;
int k;
k = i + j;
```
Variable *k* is assigned the value `8` in the last line of code
because the `+` sign adds up the values from *i* and *j*.
In the above examples, the operator (the `+` sign) can be
can be replaced with one of the following:

| symbol | elaboration |.
| --- | --- |
| + | Add
| - | Subtraction |
| * | Multiply |
| / | Divide
| % | Returns the remainder after division. For example: |
| | 7 % 5 = 2 |
| | 11 % 2 = 1 |
| | 6 % 2 = 0 |
