# Additional tasks variables/strings

## Case Study 1 - Find the Word
Write a program that satisfies the following requirements:
+ User can enter a sentence (a line of text).
+ User can enter a word (a piece of text without spaces) in a second input field.
+ The program displays the position (index) on the screen where the entered word is in the sentence. The position starts counting at 1. If the word is not in the sentence then the position is 0.

For example, in the sentence "The apple doesn't fall far from the tree." the word "apple" occurs at position 4.

## Case Study 2 - BMI Calculator
Write a program that calculates a person's BMI and displays it on the screen.
Tip: prior to programming (=realization phase), you will conduct a brief preliminary research (=analysis) answering the following questions:
+ What is BMI?
+ How do you calculate BMI for a man/woman of a certain age?
 
## Case study 3 - Area calculator
Write a program that calculates the area of a circle. The user enters the centerline of the circle and the program displays the area of the circle with that centerline on the screen.

Tip: Perform a brief analysis in which you find out the answer to the question How do you calculate the area of a circle?

## Case Study 4 - Listbox filler
Create a program with a ListBox, a TextBox and a Button. When the user clicks the Button then the text that is in the TextBox (the user can type in whatever he wants) is added to the list in the ListBox.

## Case Study 5 - Ak-tester
Create a program that allows the user to enter a text and click a button. After clicking the button, a text appears on the screen indicating the position at which the phrase ak occurs.

Example scenario: the user enters the word "goudakaas". The program should then show the result 5 after pressing the button (because the - first-occurring - substring ak is at the 5th position).

## Case Study 6 - Your actual age
Create a program that given the user's name (first name + last name) and his age shows the "actual age" that user is on the screen.

The "actual age" of a user is determined as follows:
+ The entered age minus 12 multiplied by the tenth part of the number of letters of his full name.

## Case Study 7 - Guess-a-number (if-statement)
Assignment: write an application that satisfies the following requirements:
+ The user must be able to enter a number in a TextBox (i.e. not use a control other than a TextBox). The user enters a number and clicks a button.
+ If after clicking the button the number is equal to 3 then the user is correct and a text appears informing the user of this. If a number other than 3 is entered, another text appears notifying the user that it is not correct.

Once this works then extend your application with the following functionality:
+ Your program, if the user's answer is wrong, indicates whether the number is higher or lower than the number 3 to be guessed.
 
## Case Study 8 - Converting distances to km.
In England they use 'inch', 'foot', 'yard' and 'mile'. Create a program with a text box, radio button and button to convert this to kilometers.
The user can enter a number in the textbox and then use radio buttons to choose what that represents.

For example, enter 1 in the textbox and then select the radio button for 'mile'. When the button is pressed, the number of miles is displayed. In this example 1.6 km. Always round off to 1 decimal place.
