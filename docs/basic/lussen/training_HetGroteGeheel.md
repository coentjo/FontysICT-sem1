# Training - While - The big picture

  

Create an application with a while loop including a variable “total”. In this while loop, a random digit is generated. This random number is added to the variable “total”. When the variable “total” exceeds 1000, a message is given “The number is now higher!”.

  

Extend the program that you can enter the “higher than number” yourself.
