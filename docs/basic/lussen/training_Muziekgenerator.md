# Training - For - Music generator.

  

Create an application where the user can specify the number of notes to be played consecutively. Then randomly choose from the notes C, D, E, F, G, A and B. Optionally (50% chance) you must note a sharp (#) with the notes C, D, F, G and A. Put the outcome of the piece of music in a label, textbox, MessageBox or give the output in the console.

For example, the user might want to play 10 notes. The application might then randomly come up with the following batch of notes: 

**D - E - F# - F# - C - B - G# - A# - A - A#**
